## Algorithms Details
### 1. HashMap with Separate Chaining & Linear Probing
  - Files:
    - DataStructuresandAlgorithms/HashMapwAVL.py
    - DataStructuresandAlgorithms/SeperateChaining.py

  - Time complexity:
    - search/Insert:
      - Avg Case: O(1)
      - Worst Case: O(n)

  - Example of usage:
    - Use to combine data from multiple CSV/Data.
      - contactCT.py: Line 111
      - FindContacted_SE.py: Line 256

### 2. AVL Tree
  - Files:
    - DataStructuresandAlgorithms/AVL.py

  - Time complexity
    - search/insert:
      - Avg/Worst Case: O(log n)

  - Example of usage:
    - Use to remove duplicated data when merging CSV/Data.
    - Inorder return to retirved sorted data,
      - contactCT.py: Line 196
      - sms.py: Line 58

### 3.  Linked List
  - Files:
    - DataStructuresandAlgorithms/linked_list.py

  - Time complexity
    - search:
      - Avg/Worst Case: O(n)
    - Insertion/Deletion:
      - Avg/Worst Cse: O(1)

  - Example of usage:
    - Used for data processing for adding attributes for plotting of HeatMap
      - dataPrep_HeatMap.py: Line 6

### 4. Queue
  - Files:
    - DataStructuresandAlgorithms/queue.py

  - Time complexity
    - enqueue/dequeue:
      - Avg/Worst Case: O(1)

  - Example of usage:
    - used to phone number in a queue and ensure all contact received SHN Notice.
      - sms.py: Line 67

### 5. Stack
  - Files:
    - DataStructuresandAlgorithms/stack.py

  - Time complexity
    - push/pop:
      - Avg/Worst Case: O(1)

  - Example of usage:
    - Used to store location data in stack and together with ADT.
      - clusterTable.py: Line 56
      
### 6. Abstract Data Type
  

## Technical Note of HashMap for Presentation 
### HashMap 
  - Implicit linked link 
  - Linked List component is abstracted out and implemented in HashMap 

### Linear Probing
  - HashMap is implemented using a list (as compared to a dictionary used in lecture slides)
  - List has O(n) lookup time, while Dict has O(1) lookup time
  - Use a List to implement a HashTable using Linear (switch to quadratic? - to reduce clustering) probing to simulate a dictionary implementation 
  - Using Date as Key: Date is converted to integer for linear probing 

### Removing Duplicate in HashMap 
  - Linear search requires O(n) on linked link upon each search
  - Frequency of search: N
  - Total: O(n^2)
  - Is there a better way?
