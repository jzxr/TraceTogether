## Technical Note of HashMap for Presentation 
### HashMap 
  - Implicit linked link 
  - Linked List component is abstracted out and implemented in HashMap 

### Linear Probing
  - HashMap is implemented using a list (as compared to a dictionary used in lecture slides)
  - List has O(n) lookup time, while Dict has O(1) lookup time
  - Use a List to implement a HashTable using Linear (switch to quadratic? - to reduce clustering) probing to simulate a dictionary implementation 
  - Using Date as Key: Date is converted to integer for linear probing 

### Removing Duplicate in HashMap 
  - Linear search requires O(n) on linked link upon each search
  - Frequency of search: N
  - Total: O(n^2)
  - Is there a better way?
